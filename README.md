# Lanyi_adict and his friends Web
## Introduction 
This is my personal website, which introduces my personal education situation, paper publication, research direction, project situation, personal skills, and award situation. It also includes the official website of **Hongming Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd**. This website is a technology team that I led during my undergraduate studies. Most of the members are college students in the fields of science and engineering, covering multiple engineering majors such as **Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Mechanical Engineering, Microelectronics, and Applied Statistics**. These websites provided introductions to team members and also introduced our open source project. This website is implemented using technologies such as **HTML5**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, while the membership diagram and skill tree are implemented using **Echarts** technology.<br>

## Relationship map and skill tree
<img src = "img/.png">
This graph is drawn using the Echarts technique.

```javascript

```
The formatter function is used to customize the display of a tooltip. When a user hovers over a data node on the chart, a tooltip displays the details of the data.

```javascript

```
This is the code for the Ecahrts code to build each node of the image
```javascript

```
This code snippet is used to define the style and label of the line (edge) between two nodes in the diagram.

## Continue development
I will continue to develop the front-end of the website based on my learning situation, and I will progress and learn together with my team members

## Warning
There are still some bugs in this website, which means that I have to fix it in the future.
